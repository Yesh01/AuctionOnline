Summary of Key IFs

    IF Add Item clicked but fields are not filled → Show error message.
    IF Start Auction clicked but no item added → Show error message.
    IF row in the Admin Panel's table is selected → Allow editing unless the item has a bidder and a sold timestamp.

    -----> 2ND DRAFT FOR UPDATED Algo

Updated Algorithm:

I've made some updates to the algorithm to include the new controller classes and database integration. Here's the updated algorithm:

Database Integration:

We'll use a SQL database to store auction data, items, bids, and users. We'll use JDBC or Hibernate to interface with the database.
